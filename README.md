# graphanime

This is a project. The goal of this project has to help someone who research some animes related with an other anime.
We made a graph who shows us several communities. Thoses communities has been created by genres.
In fact, if an anime with an other anime has 3 genres (or plus) in common, this will be create two nodes(anime) and one edge linked with them.
